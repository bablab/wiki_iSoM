Physiological Hook-up Ask the participant if they need to use the rest room Collect Height and Weight measurements (enter into REDCap). Ask the participant if they have any skin allergies or sensitives Summarize/explain the physiology procedure to the participant i.e., “Ok, so now I am going to place some sensors on your body. The sensors will stick to your skin but can be easily peeled off. I will place two sensors on your right and left collarbones, and one on your lower left rib cage. I will clean the area with an alcohol wipe and some gauze. I will walk you through everything as we go, but if you have any questions or anything feels uncomfortable, don’t hesitate to let me know.” Place ECG Electrodes: Find where you will place sensor Clean the area with the alcohol wipe and then gauze Apply a small dot of electrode gel to the sensor Stick the sensor to the skin Repeat for all 3 spots Have Participant sit in chair (in front of stimulus computer). Attached leads to electrodes ECG &amp; Respiration attach to same transmitter Check Signals in Acqknowledge HBD Task Open Psychopy Run HBD Task First complete 2-min baseline Then explain task instructions Have participant complete task (40 trials) Clean-up Stop the physio recording Detect the wires from the participant Have participant remove sensors They can do this themselves or you can help if they prefer “Ripping it off like a Band-Aid” is NOT best approach typically Hold the skin, while peeling up, usually works best – if sensors are particularly sticky Pilot Interview After completing the HBD task and removing sensors, complete the pilot interview Verbally ask questions to the participant and take notes of their answers in REDCap 3.3 Questionnaires Demographics BAB Lab Health Questionnaire Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Pennebaker, J.

The HBD device is built using an Ardunio Uno3. The Task contains 40 trials (10 beats per trial). For each trial, participants responds for accuracy (Output: 1 = in-sync; 0 = out-of-sync), and confidence (0-100 continuous; Greater value = more confident.) “In-sync” trials have a fixed offset of 200ms. “Out-of-sync” trials have a fixed offset of 500ms. 4.3 Data Storage The questionnaire data is stored in REDCap. Physiological data and HBD Task outputs are stored on Box. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
